                    <p>Majour problems I hit during development was: </p><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Copyright of the images all images in the website was taken from flaticon where it has very specific attributation rules for free users, This caused a problem where i needed to put an attributation underneath each image, i got round this problem by placing a footer at the bottom of the page that had all the attributation.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Background. I struggled to find a background that i was happy with. At first i attemted to find images that i thought would fit the theme as i didn't want a single solid colour as the background. I eventually found a soloution where i used a colour gradient to give a subtle colour shift over the background.</p></li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Chat messages: For the chat messages i set it into two parts Message information and System information; </li>

                        <li>Message information contained only the information but depending on sender would add a specific class: This was to achieve colouration of chat messages.</li>
                        <li> System messages was seperated and contained sender and time sent. This was seperated from message information by giving this specific classs section a gray background no matter the user.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Chat messages colouration: This was one of the first tasks i attempted. I ended up using an if statement to specify which section was added by the using the Username as a key.</li>
                        <li>Typing indicator: This was trial and error as i divised several methods but ended on the current method of a timer as i thought it best suited the task. This system Takes advantage of the constant keypresses (and function activation) during typing in which if idle it increases a timer but on key press resets timer, if idle for > 2s: Display active msg</li>
                        <li>Status indicators: I.e Active or Typing: I took what was already built in the active user section (side-nav) and placed two images but only displayed one at a time and on keypress it would switch.</li>
